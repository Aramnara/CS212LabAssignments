/*Problem 1: Write a class called ArrayListPractice. You only need a
static main method to create an ArrayList of Strings called countries.
        • use add method with just a Country name as a parameter to create a
        few entries.
        • Print the size of the countries using the size method.
        • Use add(index, countryName) to enter new countries in between the
        existing countries list.
        • Print the size of the coteries list using size() method.
        • Use set(index, countryName) to replace the existing entry at index with
        a new entry at few places, and print the size of the list to see if the size
        changed or not.
        • Use the get(index) method to print a country at that index.
        • Use the get(countryName) method to print a country that is in the list.
        • Use the contains(object o) method to check if the list contains the
        country o.
        • Use indexOf(Object o) to get the index of a country that is in the list.
        • Print the list using for each loop every now and then.

            Problem 2 Create a class named Circle with a single private instant
        variable called radius. The class should have a default constructor, an overloaded
        constructor that takes a int parameter and assigns the value to the
        radius. An accessor (get) method and a set method, an area method that
        calculates and returns the area as a double value, and a toString() methods
        should all be written.
        • Write a test class to create and store 10 Circle objects in an ArrayList<Circle>
        of circles.
        • Each entry of the ArrayList circles should be a new Circle object with
        it’s unique radius.
        • generate the radius using Math.random()* 10. (Math.random() gives
        a double value between 0 and 1 as decimal value. So multiply it by 10
        and cast it to int to get an integer.
        • Print the ArrayList.
        • Create an array called circleArray of type Circle with the capacity of
        the size of the ArrayList circles.
        • Fill the array with the data in the ArrayList circles using toArray(circleArray).
        • Sort the circles in the array in increasing value of the radius using
        insertion sort.
        • Create a new ArrayList<Circle> sortedCircles object using the Arrays
        class method Array.asList(circleArray).
        ArrayList<Cirlce> sortedCircles= new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(circleArray));
        • Print the ArrayList sortedCircles to check if the list is sorted.
