Problem 1:
        • Create an interface StringStack and write the header lines of the four
        methods that any class that wants to implement this interface has to
        define. You look up the same four methods that we wrote for the
        IntStack except the pop() method should return a String instead of
        int.
        • Create a class called StringDynStack that implements the StringStack
        interface.
        • You need two instance variables: One called the top which represents
        the top of the stack, and the second is a String array called data.
        • You can write a single argument constructor that has an int parameter
        which represents the capacity of the array.
        • Set the top to -1 (you can also set it to 0, in which case you need to
        define the size of the Stack appropriately).
        • Write utility methods, getSize() and isEmpty() methods to find the the
        size and to check if the stack is empty.
        • Define the two methods push() and pop() to store and retrieve data
        respectively from the Stack.
        • Write a toString() method.
        Now create a Test class similar to IDStack.java to make your array a
        dynamic array and test with Strings to test StringDynStack class. Study
        how we doubled the length of the original array.
